# Chapter 1 - Introduction                          

This chapter introduces readers to the world of penguins – what they are, their physical characteristics, their shape and size, where they live, what they eat – all while introducing readers to some basic facts about penguins’ lives throughout history in different regions around the world today! This chapter also outlines types of penguins as well as differences between male/female penguins in terms of physiology as well as behavior which is important for readers to understand before delving in further chapters!         

## 1.1. what they are:

Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere. They are highly adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, with webbed feet and a streamlined shape. Penguins have short wings that are not suitable for flight, but instead help them swim quickly in the water.

## 1.2 Physical Characteristics: 

Penguins have black and white feathers which provide camouflage in the water. Some species also have yellow or orange markings on their heads and chests. Penguins can range in size from 13 inches (33 cm) to nearly 3 feet (90 cm) tall! Their weight varies depending on species, but most penguins weigh between 2-10 pounds (1-4 kg).

## 1.3 Shape and Size: 

The shape of a penguin is designed for maximum efficiency in the water; they have a flat tail that acts as a rudder, flippers which act as oars, and webbed feet to help propel them forward while swimming. The larger penguins are more powerful swimmers than the smaller ones. Penguins typically stand upright and waddle when walking on land, but when swimming they mostly remain underwater and use their wings to propel themselves through the water. 

## 1.4 Where they Live: 

Most penguins live in Antarctica, though some species inhabit subantarctic islands such as New Zealand’s South Island or South Georgia Island off the coast of Argentina. Other species of penguin live further north, including Galapagos Penguins who reside near the equator along the coasts of Peru and Ecuador! 

## 1.5 What They Eat: 

Penguins primarily feed on krill (tiny shrimp-like crustaceans), squid, fish, and other small sea creatures found in cold ocean waters around Antarctica and its neighboring islands. Some species will also occasionally eat small land animals such as insects or lizards if food is scarce near shorelines or nesting grounds!
