# II. Habitat and Life Cycle 

Penguins are amazing creatures that live in some of the most extreme and remote environments on Earth. They inhabit a wide range of habitats, from icy polar regions to warm tropical islands. Penguins have adapted to their environment over millions of years, and their unique behaviors, diet, and life cycle are all influenced by where they live. 

## A. Where Do Penguins Live?

Penguins live in large colonies that can be found along the coasts of Antarctica, South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Peru and the Falkland Islands. The majority of the species inhabit the Southern Hemisphere’s coldest climates near the Antarctic Circle. However, there is one species – the Galapagos penguin – which lives at temperatures slightly above freezing in equatorial regions around Ecuador’s Galapagos Islands. 

## B. The Migration of Penguins 

Due to their adaptation to cold climates, penguins migrate every year to find food in warmer waters and more hospitable climates during the austral summer months (November-February). Some species such as emperor penguins will travel up to 600 miles during their migration journey while others may stay relatively close to their breeding colonies throughout the year. 

## C. Breeding, Courtship and Reproduction 

Penguins typically mate for life and form strong social bonds with each other during mating season which lasts from September through February depending on location and species. During this time courtship behavior is highly visible among pairs as they parade around each other displaying physical displays such as bowing or head shaking while vocalizing calls or honks towards one another as signs of affection.  

### 1. Courtship Behavior 

Courtship behavior varies between species but generally involves activities like preening each other’s feathers or displaying various postures such as bowing or head shakes in order to express interest in one another leading up to copulation which only takes place once a pair has formed a strong bond with each other during courtship displays lasting anywhere from several minutes to several days depending on location and species. 
    
### 2. Reproductive Strategies for Raising Chicks 

Once mating has taken place eggs are laid usually between October-January depending on location and species with both parents taking turns incubating them until hatching occurs around 30-65 days later when chicks emerge from their shells weighing just 3-4 ounces (90-120 grams). To ensure survival chicks rely heavily on both parents who help protect them from predators while also providing food for them until they are able to feed themselves at around three weeks old after which chicks will gradually become independent over a period of months as they reach adulthood at two years old capable of mating soon afterwards completing the cycle anew
